# RealTimeBusTracking-Exercise
My task in this project was to animate a marker in a map of the city of Boston so that the marker would show the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

Open the index.http file on a browser to see how it works.

Roadmap to future improvements: Eventually I will work on mapping longer routs and marking the stops I would have to make for gas taking into consideration the car's gas milage.
